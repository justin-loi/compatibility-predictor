# Compatibility Predictor
This is a Javascript program that uses Node.js to read and write JSON files. The JSON input consists of an array of applicants and an array of team members. 
The program reads through the applicants and using the team as a reference, determines a compatibility score for each applicant. 

# Setup
In order to run this project, simply open the repository in an environment that has Node.js installed and type `node driver.js` to build the program. 

# Input/Output
The program takes the input by reading the JSON input through the `input.json` file.
The output is generated in JSON into the `output.json` file.
